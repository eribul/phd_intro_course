# Research plan

*This chapter constitute an Individual Study Plan for PhD studies performed by Erik Bülow at the Department of orthopedics, Institute of clinical sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, and by the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register.*


## Background

Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common and well established procedure to
increase quality of life for patients with:

* Hip osteoarthritis, which is a major contributor to global disability and the
most common reason for hip arthroplasty (more than 80 % in Sweden). THA is an
elective treatment for this group of patients and is therefore offered mainly to
relatively healthy individuals. 
* Hip fracture of the femoral neck is the second
most common cause (around 10 %) and mainly affects older and fragile patients
8more women then men). 
* Other causes such as inflamation, malignancy or causes
related to child diseases, acount for a small fraction. These patients are not
included in the proposed research project.

The incidence of hip arthroplasty is approximately 16,000 annual cases in Sweden
and the need is increasing due to longer life spans and therefore an increasing
elderly population.

It is known that the patients’ preoperative health characteristics have an
important impact on their health status after hip arthroplasty. Sharing this
information with the patients in form of a shared decision-making tool (SDM)
have been long advocated. It presumes that preoperative medical information and
patient-reported outcome measures can aid the medical profession to make
adequate prediction of patient outcomes.

One of the main challenges in constructing such a shared decision making tool is
to gather sufficient and relevant data. As data often needs to be collected from
different sources and come in different shapes and formats. The limiting factor
is not the scale but the heterogeneity of the data. In order to succeed with SDM
tools, fine-grained data are required to build models actionable at individual
level.

Sweden facilitates linkage-studies by the adoption of the 10-digit personal
identity number (PIN) maintained by the Swedish Tax Agency. This 10-digit PIN
allows a near-by 100 per cent coverage of the Swedish healthcare system and it
is instrumental for linkage between population and health data registers.

Beside the top-down initiated governmental agencies, so called "quality
registers" have been initiated and managed by the medical profession during the
last couple of decades. These provide data centered around diagnoses, implants
or medical procedures. In addition to facilitating national, regional and local
quality improvement programs, they also provide research data of high quality. 
In this research project, we will focus on data from The Swedish Hip
Arthroplasty Register (SHAR); one of the first quality registers in Sweden,
founded in 1979.



## Overall Research Aim and Central Research Questions

A current research aim for SHAR is to develop a shared decision making tool for
patients with total hip arthroplasty. The development of such a tool has already
been initiated by the register. It is the goal of this project to contribute
with evaluation of some statistical and epidemiological methods of value. It is
here not only of value to develop new methods but also to question sometimes
unjustified methods previously recommended.

We will put special attention on the following research questions:

1. Is the current practice to predict mortality by comorbidity really of value
to otherwise healthy patients with elective total hip arthroplasty? 
2. Does this
aspect differ considering the smaller and quite different patient group with hip
arthroplasty after acute hip fracture? 
3. Can we improve the current practice of
handling missing comorbidity data for prediction of mortality? 
4. Can we also
put all this into practice by contributing with software tools to facilitate
patient classification of comorbidity and other relevant data? 
5. How do we best
describe and model patients with bilateral hip arthroplasty?

The project is thus a mix between epidemiology, statistics, medicine and
computer science (a mix sometimes refereed to as "data science").



## Data

![Schematic description of our data and its sources.](isp_data.png)


Data have already been acquired from three main sources (figure 1).

1. The starting point was SHAR from where we identified all first time (primary)
hip arthroplasty surgeries in Sweden from 1992 to 2013. This data is identified
by personal identification number (PIN) and laterality (left or right hip). 
2. The SHAR data set was submitted to the National Board of Health and Welfare
(Socialstyrelsen) who supplied us with comorbidity data from the national
patient register (NPR). They removed the PIN and replaced it with a serial
number in order to anonymize the data. 
3. Next, the National Board of Health and Welfare forwarded the list of PIN's and serial numbers directly to Statistics
Sweden (SCB) to obtain requested socioeconomic variables. 
4. Finally, Statistics
Sweden returned a data set to SHAR with the serial number and laterality as the
only unique identifiers.



## Ethics

This project does not involve any patients directly, nor any regular medical
journals or biological samples. We do on the other hand use extensive data of
sensitive nature. It is therefore important to secure the integrity of all
patients indirectly involved.

This type of study does not require informed consent from registered patients.
Neither has it been mandatory to inform the patients about the registration in
SHAR, during most of the period when our data was collected. It is however
mandatory today and it is also possible (although uncommon) for patients to now
withdraw their previous "consent" of registration.

Data in a quality register is owned by the organisations treating the patients
and it should be primarily used for quality assurance and development of medical
procedures within each clique or hospital. The distinguish between this and
research is not clear-cut but an ethical approval for the research was retrieved
from the Regional Ethical Review Board in Gothenburg (reference number 271-14).

During the whole process we will make sure that no patients will be identified
on an individual level. The key for linking the serial numbers to the PIN is
saved at the National Board of Health and Welfare and researchers will under no
circumstances be granted access to this key.

We will also ensure that patients and other interested parties are kept informed
about the research performed. This is done through a project data base on SHAR's
web site.



## Theory of science

The very goal of the project is to use the deductive principles of mathematics,
through the applied and best available methods of statistics to ensure that the
empirical observations from patient data will result in reliable and sound
conclusions based on induction and deduction combined.

It is the belief of this project that scientific principles are not always
falsified even when they could be, and that research methods are sometimes
proposed for one area but then adopted to others, where the same circumstances
or assumptions do no longer apply. It is our aim to uncover some black boxes and
to re-evaluate if some common practices are really valuable for a shared
decision making tool for treatment with hip arthroplasty.



## Individual Studies

We aim at five individual studies to complete the thesis.




### Mortality predicted by comorbidity after elective total hip arthroplasty


#### Background

It is often suggested that studies on mortality should adjust for possible
comorbidities as con-founders. The International Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision (ICD-10)-based comorbidity indices, such as the Elixhauser or the
Charlson, have been developed for this purpose and many researches have
investigated their reliability. The practice has also proved useful for patients
with life threatening diseases such as cancer for whom death is a possible
outcome.


#### Aim

We intend to investigate the long-term predicative power of the Elixhauser and
Charlson comorbidity indices for patients with total hip arthroplasty. Elective
hip arthroplasty is offered to otherwise healthy individuals. It is therefore
unlikely that this cohort suffer from diseases causing death in a nearby time
frame. It might therefore not be relevant to predict their mortality by
co-morbidities present already before the surgery. To avoid that burden would be
preferable to a DSM since this practice requires massive external data from
outside the SHAR register.

Also, when short-term survival predictions are undertaken, statistical methods
more suited for a binary outcome (such as death within a specified time frame)
are often used. It is therefore our intention to apply a statistical method
specially developed for survival data and to carefully investigate all relevant
assumptions for such a method to hold.



### Mortality predicted by comorbidity after acute total hip arthroplasty


#### Background

Around 90 percent of all hip arthroplasties in Sweden are offered as elective
treatments after osteoarthritis. Every tenth prosthesis is nevertheless the
result of acute hip fracture. Acute hip fractures happens most often to old and
fragile patients for whom comorbidity might be a more relevant predictor of
mortality.

#### Aim

We aim to investigate similar aspects as for the previous study but for patients
with hip fractures.



### Validation of methods for missing comorbidity data

#### Background

If comorbidity would be a relevant predictor of mortality, it would also be
necessary to investigate how current methods and comorbidity data could be used.
Data on comorbidity is not easily gathered, not even in Sweden that is otherwise
world leading regarding register studies and availability of public and well
organized data centered around the PIN.

It is common practice to use data from the national patient register but this
does not cover primary health care and its quality and reliability differ
between public and private health care providers and between somatic and
psychiatric health care.


#### Aim

It is our intention to compare data from the national patient register to data
from the medical prescription register. We will also evaluate if the common
practice to combine patients without registered comorbidities, with patients
completely missing from the data source at hand, is actually relevant due to
survival and self-reported quality of life, or if these two patient groups
should be differentiated.

This is a methodological question not only relevant for the Swedish hip
arthroplasty register. We therefore intend to collaborate with the national
diabetes register and to also compare the result with a sample from the general
Swedish population.




### Software Development to facilitate fast deterministic (patient) classification

#### Background

To investigate comorbidity on a large scale such as now intended, it is useful
to have a supporting computer infra structure. The open-source and freely
available R software is the preferred choice for many statisticians, and we want
to work with comorbidity classification within this framework. A first naive
implementation took around 18 hours to run on a standard computer. The best
available R-package found on-line reduced the time to around half an hour but
this is still quite slow for the modern computer era.


#### Aim

We decided to develop an R-package of our own with the goal to reach computation
time close to half a minute. This is done by a change of underlying data
structure both regarding data sets and code identification schemes. Most of the
work concerns the software package itself but we do intend to describe the
implementation in an article worth publishing in a software oriented journal.

The implementation will be based on abstract principles and therefore of
interest also to other classification problems, such as for adverse events (as
identified by similar methodology as comorbidities, but after, and not before,
the time of surgery).



### Modelling strategies for bilateral total hip arthroplasty

#### Background

Most patients with hip arthroplasty have one hip replaced (unilateral cases). It
is however not uncommon to have arthroplasty also for the second hip (bilateral
cases). This introduce problems when analyzing and modelling hip arthroplasty
data, since two hips from the same patient can not be assumed independent (which
is assumed by most standard statistical methods to work properly).

It is now common to simply ignore the last operated hip for patients with
bilateral cases. Statistically more advanced methods have also been proposed in
the literature but they have so far not been evaluated for these patients in
practice.


#### Aim

It is our intention to first characterize possible differences between the first
and secondly operated hip, and between patients with one and two hips operated.
We will thereafter also investigate, and finally suggest possible statistical
methods to use for future analyses containing bilateral cases.


## Supervising

This project requires cross-disciplinary supervising. Professor Göran Garellick
and orthopedic surgeon Ola Rolfson will provide expertise in orthopedics related
questions. Statistics related issues will be supervised by Szilard Nemes,
statistician at the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register.






# Commentrary

*This chapter contains general comments regarding the research plan.*

## Theory of Science


I did in fact have a look at the assignment list before submitting the first
draft of the research plan. I did therefore have the chance to also include a
section on theory of science already from the start.


### Scientific ideal

As stated there, I think that my project might differ slightly from my peers due
to my background in the non-empirical field of mathematics. Mathemathematics is
build upon logic. By so, it shares its common ground with theoretical
philosophy. "Induction" exist as a term also in mathematics but with a different
meaning. I will here use the term "induction" in the sence of "statistical
inference".

Using that meaning of the term, it is indeed the scientific ideal my research
will rely upon. It might be notet however that in my case, using data from a
quality register data, the population of interest might be seen as almost
completely covererd by the sample at hand. Hence, leaving less room for
generealisation and real "inductivist" tecniches. I tend to not agree though.
Our "sample" might have good "coverage" and "completeness" compared to the
population with Swedish identification numbers operated in Sweden during the
years of interest. The proportion of non-Sweish recidence operated with total
hip arthroplasty (THA) in Sweden might be marginal, as well as the proportion of
Swedish recidences operated elsewere. It might however be of great interest to
possibly generalise some of the results also to other countries with similair
health care system as ours. A long term goal is also to facilitate predictions
useful to future patients. Extrapolation as such might not be completely
justified by any scientific framework but it doed nevertheless make us dependent
on inductive reasoning.


### Falsification

It is also the ideal to falsify a "tiny bit of paradigm" by rejecting the
hypothesis that mortality for THA patients can be reasonably predicted by
comorbidity. This was formulated as an hypothesis in the beginning of the
project, but did as such rely on earlier observations.


### Hypothesis testing

What we here mean by "hypothesis" though might not fit entirely within the
statistical inference paradigm. It is a hypothesis for sure but we do not really
treat it as such during the study. We are relying on fairly new statistical
methods for estimating predictive power for survival data. Theoretical methods,
and even computer software does exist, but only for point estimates of a
centrality measure. A variance stimator is also needed to construct confidence
interval and to test a formal hypothesis. Today, the litterature suggest use of
more empirical methods such as "bootstraping" (a resampling method) to construct
such an estimate. The data at hand, combined with available computing resources
does however not permit such an estimate to be easily done (it is simply too
computer intence). We therefore decided to also incorporate a more practical
software developing part of the project with the aim to make such computations
possible in the future.





## Research Methodology

### The research and its potential relevance

My research project is on total hip arthroplasty. This is now a comon procedure,
performed to appriximately 16,000 Swedish patients yeach year. Patients usually
get an offer of hip replacement if this seem like a reasonable treatment for
osteoarthrisis or any other relevant indication. They the nneed to eiher accept
or decline that offer. That desicion might be based on weightning pros and cons
of potential side effects and adverse events. Our research goal is to provide
both the patient, but also the treating physician, with a shared decision making
tool. It is here the goal to use readily available patient data for the basis of
a recommendation whether to operate or not. We hope that this will reduce the
number of THA:s causing more harm than good, and ikevise that patiants with a
potentially good outcome will indeed take on the offer.


### Current research methodology

My project was initiated by the Swedish Hip Arthroplasty Register. As such, it
is intended to mainly use data from the register. With the use of personal
identification numbers, we are also able to link our register data to other
already available registers. We therefore include information on possible
comorbidities (the Swedish patient register), medical prescriptions (the
prescription register), date of death (the population register) etcetera. This
data is alredady available and the sources will be useable also in the future as
long as these registers are maintained.

An obvious drawback with this "fixed data set" is that we have limited
possibilities to extend the information that is alredady available. Also, some
data was collected for different reasons than research, which might be reflected
on data quality. Some health care providers have for example used the patient
register as part of a payment system, causing  skewed incitaments for diagnose
registration.

Also, the formulation of each question has to be standardised. Most questions
therefore have a fixed set of possible alternative answers that each procedure
and patient has to be squeezed into, sometimes with sucess, sometimes not. This
also applies to some qualitative questions regarding the patients own
perceptions of their current health status (pationt reposter outcome measures;
EQ5D).

Except its limitation, register data of this sort has the potential to be a good
descriptor of current clinical practice. It is therefore well suited for
observational studies but it does not help us with causality.



### Alternative research methodologies

Some alternative research methods could be considered:

* A randomzed clinical trial would probably not be possible. Comorbidity is an
independent factor of ours but we could not ethically induce random patients
with various comorbidities just to study a possible change of mortality. 
* Animal studies does not seem like a reasonable method either. First, the use of
hip prothesis is probably not relevant for four-legged animals if the goal os to
transer the results to human. This would leave us with limited options of animal
models. Second, the required scale of such an experiment would just be too big
to handle. 
* Instead of using register data, it might be possible to use data
also from medical journals or other sources. To extract such infomration as
complement to register studies is not uncommon. But it is cumbersome and in this
case, the obvious benefits are not clear. 
* To extend the (currently limited)
subjective patient information would be interesting and probably relevant. It
could be very meaningful to retrieve information not only regarding fixed
comorbidity classes but also on percieved health status and severity of each
coexisting comorbidity. It would have the potential to give a deeper
understanding of feelings and reasong behind a patients decision to accept or
decline the offer of THA. Similar questions would be relevant also for treating
physicians. It would be interesting to study their strategies of patient
communication and reasong when offering such procedure. This is unfourtenataly
outside the scope of the current study but might be proposed for the future.






## Research Ethics

I did explore some ethical issues already in the research plan. I was however
more focused on the research process itself and not on its potential outcome.

Direct benefits for the research subjects themselves would be very limited.
Since we study mortality, some of the included patients have already died. The
risk for these patients is on the other hand quite limited too.

The short-term utcome of the project will probably be in form of gained
information to use for further reserach. There is however an end goal of
building a shared decision making tool. Possible benefits of such tool has
already been discussed. Potential risks on the other hand might lie in a
potential miss-use of such tool. The intention of the tool is not to replace any
of the current tools aiding the patients and physicians decision process. The
most relevant data might still be out of reach from what we can capture from
register data.

A possible missuse of a shared decision making tool would be if policy makers
used it to withhold possible treatment to patients needing it (for example due
to economical reasons).

To avoid such malicious miss-use can of course never be garanteed but we do
think that potential benefits outweight the risks.

It might also be of relevant to mention that the register data can only be used
for the research process itself. Hence, we can build a model using current data,
and we might use this model to predict outcome for future patients. Curremt
legislation does however not permit that future patients register data is used
directly for a clinical decission (since the quality register data is not signed
the same way as a medical journal). It is therefore necessary for the physician
to dubble-register the data once more for the shared decision making tool (even
though the same data might be already available from the register). This might
be cumbersume to the doctor but it might also make it a little more transparent
to the patient excactly which information is used as a basis for the
recommendation.



## Information Retrieval 

I started to search for comorbidity as MeSH term but
that gave me too broad results. I therefore limited it to specific mentions of
either Charlson or Elixhauser:
